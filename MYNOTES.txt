designs.js

The designs.js file is my Final Version of the Project. It is linked in the HTML.



designs_V2_colorcomp.js 

In this Version I tried work around having to click a cell twice when choosing a different  color. I have found a way, which involves color comparison. Reading up on it, I have found out it is NOT a solution that will hold up in ALL browsers, and color comparison in general should not be done, for that reason.
I would love to hear a way of doing this in my Project Review. Thanks!
